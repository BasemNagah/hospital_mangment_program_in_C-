 **Hospital Queue System in C++**

Just wrapped up a quick Hospital Queue System project in C++. Check it out:

👩‍⚕️ **Features:**
- 20 specializations, from Children to Surgery.
- Each specialization has a 5-patient queue.

➕ **Adding a Patient:**
- Enter specialization (1-20).
- Provide name and status (0 = regular, 1 = urgent).
- Apologize and decline if the queue is full.
- Regular patients go to the end, urgent ones to the front.

📜 **Waiting Patients:**
- Displays waiting patients for specializations with queues.

👩‍⚕️ **Doctor Pickup:**
- Enter the specialization.
- Informs the doctor if no patients are waiting.
- Asks the patient to go with the doctor and removes them from the queue.
